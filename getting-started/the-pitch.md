# The Pitch

A how-to guide for onboarding businesses in your community.

<hr />

While we encourage everyone to pitch Oshi according to their own style, this is the generic pitch that works for us. It doesn't have to be perfect.

## ⚡ Briefly explain Oshi to the owner or manager

Keep it simple.

<p style="padding: 20px; border-left: 5px solid #cccccc;">
<strong>
"There's this new promotions app called Oshi that enables businesses to reward customers in bitcoin for shopping local."</strong>
</p>

<p style="background-color: #ecfdf5; padding: 20px; border-left: 5px solid #10b981;">
If there's already nearby businesses on the app, make sure you mention it and/or show them a quick demo.  - Feel free to show them other locations like Austin or Redding to give them an idea of how it works.
</p>

## ⚡ Compare Oshi to something they're likely familiar with

Oshi is a Bitcoin neoGroupon.

<p style="padding: 20px; border-left: 5px solid #cccccc;">
<strong>"It's sort of like Groupon, except instead of a discount, you can use bitcoin rewards as the incentive. For example, a 5% discount would translate to 5% bitcoin 'cashback' rewards on Oshi."</strong>
</p>

<div style="background-color: #f8f8f8; padding: 20px; border-left: 5px solid #f43f5e;">

While using Groupon as an example is quick and easy, some business owners may have had a bad experience with it. Be mindful of this and make sure you explain how Oshi is different.

<hr>

**Oshi**

- Instant settlement, no chargebacks
- 2.5% platform fee
- Greater promotion flexibility

**Groupon**

- Delayed settlement, chargeback risk
- 30-50% platform fee
- Strict promotion guidelines
</div>

## ⚡ Explain how it works

A quick explanation of what it would look like to the customer, and what it looks like for the business or employee.

<p style="padding: 20px; border-left: 5px solid #cccccc;">
<strong>"Locals can browse and buy the best deals all from the same app - weekly specials, happy hours, and promotions. Once purchased, the business receives the money instantly, and the customer receives a digital voucher they can redeem whenever they're ready."</strong>
</p>

<p style="background-color: #eff6ff; padding: 20px; border-left: 5px solid #2563eb;"> Whether the customer wants to redeem the voucher 10 seconds after the purchase, or 10 weeks after the purchase, the business receives the money instantly. The business is effectively running a pre-sale on their goods or services.</p>
