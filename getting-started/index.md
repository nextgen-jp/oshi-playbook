# Getting Started

Before you hit the streets, here are some ways to think about Oshi along with some simple strategies.

## What you'll need:

- A passion for bitcoin
- The Oshi App
- Your personalized Oshi referral link to earn bitcoin commissions

## Things to consider:

- Keep it simple - businesses don't need a lecture on the wonders of bitcoin in order to realize the benefits of using it via Oshi.
- Team up with bitcoiners in your area - Find a local bitcoin meetup, or start your own!
- Don't get discouraged. Not everyone will be interested... yet.
- Practice makes perfect. Just because a business says no the first time doesn't mean they won't say yes when nearby businesses are onboarded.
- Utilize your network. Someone you know might own a business or know someone who does - Sometimes that's all it takes.
